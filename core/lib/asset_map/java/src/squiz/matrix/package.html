This package holds the classes responsible for rendering the asset tree, log messages and mail messages in an applet for MySource Matrix.

<p>
At the moment, it only holds the asset tree; log messages and mail messages will be added later - but the bulk of the work is in the asset tree.
</p>

<p>
It must conform to the Flash asset map that is currently implemented in Matrix.
