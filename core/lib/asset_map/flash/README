README
------

This readme covers a couple of special "features" that I found with Flash that could probably fuck things up for other people, either developing the Asset Map or just in general.


1. Calling Parent Class Methods
-------------------------------
See the example in SUPER_METHOD_EG.as
Basically when the 'testClass.prototype.testFn declaration is removed the expected output would be :
    'Super Class -> Mid Class'
but is instead :
    'Super Class -> Mid Class -> Mid Class'

With the midClass's testFn being called twice. Don't ask me why but the easiest way to fix it is
wherever super.method() calls are made all child classes should have a fn similar to this :

    testClass.prototype.methodName = function() {
        return super.methodName();
    }

2. ScrollPane/ScrollBar
-----------------------
in the ScrollBar component in this fn 
    FScrollBarClass.prototype.setScrollProperties

change this line (currently line 81):
    this.scrollTrack_mc.onRelease = this.stopScrolling;

to this :
    this.scrollTrack_mc.onRelease = this.scrollTrack_mc.onReleaseOutside = this.stopScrolling;
