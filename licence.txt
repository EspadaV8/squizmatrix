Squiz.Net Open Source Licence Agreement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Squiz Pty Ltd (ABN 77 084 670 600) (Squiz.Net, Us or We) is the original creator
of software known as "MySource" (or sometimes as "MySource Matrix") and promoter
of Modifications (Modifications are defined in Clause 4.2) which are created by
Squiz.Net or assigned or licensed to Squiz.Net by the user under this Licence or
any other user under a licence on these terms (the Software).

This licence (the Licence) applies between Us and each user of the Software
(You, which includes the organisation in, or for, which you use the Software).
This Licence also applies to each distributed copy or extract of the Software.

PLEASE READ THIS LICENCE CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING, COPYING, USING OR
INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE. BY DOWLOADING, COPYING, USING OR INSTALLING SOFTWARE,
YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENCE.

Preamble
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Squiz.Net is dedicated to the goals of open source software development. Use of
the source code of the Software on the terms of this Licence, including to
modify and distribute it, is encouraged. That is what Clause 1 of this Licence
addresses.

Copyright law gives Squiz.Net certain rights in relation to the code We have
created. Unlike a proprietary approach to software licensing (where those rights
are used to restrict others modifying and distributing the software), We use
those rights positively to license on terms allowing modification and
distribution (ie the terms of this Licence). Copyright thereby becomes a tool
for Us to ensure all users of the Software comply with the open source
objectives of this Licence. To make that apply to Modifications users create,
this Licence causes intellectual property rights in Modifications to be assigned
or licensed back to Squiz.Net - which then become part of the "Software". That
is what Clause 2 of this Licence addresses.

As the creator and copyright holder of the Software, Squiz.Net have the right to
make the Software available under alternate licences with differing obligations
to this Licence. Rather than employ a dual licensing model (as used by some
other open source projects) and for the reassurance of all users of the
Software, We have chosen to detail the method by which Squiz.Net may choose to
conditionally release You from some of Your Licence obligations in Clause 3.

1. Right of use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Subject to Clause 2 and the legal rights of any third party, You are granted
a non-exclusive right to install, view, copy, modify, alter and add to the
Software (in source or object code form) in any way. However:

(a)  You must not introduce any virus, worm, trojan horse or malicious code into
     the Software;
(b)  You must not remove or alter any copyright notice; and
(c)  in any redistribution of Software or Modifications, you must make clear
     what code You have changed and the date of the change in a way to clearly
     distinguish it from other code.

1.2 Subject to Clause 2 and the legal rights of a third party, You are granted a
non-exclusive right to distribute (using the terms of this Licence without
alteration or addition) all or part of the Software (in source or object code
form) without having to make any kind of payment to Us. To avoid doubt Your
right of distribution includes a right to distribute Modifications to the
Software which also constitute Software under this Licence.

1.3 Nothing in this Licence prevents:

(a)  distribution of the Software as a component of an aggregate software
     distribution containing programs from several different sources;
(b)  use of the Software in a business or a particular field of endeavour; or
(c)  use of all or part of the Software together with, or as part of, another
     computer program,

however, this Licence applies, and You must ensure that it continues to apply,
to each part of the Software (including Modifications of it) despite any such
distribution or use. This Licence does not apply to any computer program other
than the Software, even if that program is distributed along with the Software.

1.4 If You distribute all or part of the Software You must do so in source code
form (regardless of whether you also distribute an object code form).

2. Intellectual Property
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 You agree that Squiz.Net owns all intellectual property rights (including
copyright) in every aspect of the Software, including source code and related
documentation.

2.2 Where Squiz.Net has created source code of Software, we believe that it does
not infringe another person's copyright, but we make no representations as to
patent infringement.

2.3 It is Your responsibility to investigate and obtain permission from the
holder of any patent for use of any patent used by the Software and to pay any
royalties to the patent holder in connection with Your use of such a patent.
However, to avoid doubt, the rights in clauses 1.1 and 1.2 include a right to
use all relevant patents held by Squiz.Net or which are assigned or licensed to
Squiz.Net under clause 2 of this Licence or under clause 2 of a licence by
Squiz.Net to another user on the terms of this Licence.

2.4 If You alter, modify or add to the Software, You hereby assign to Squiz.Net
all of Your intellectual property rights (including copyright and patent rights)
in any Modifications including copyright in any compilation comprised of any
part of the original source code of the Software and Your Modifications to the
Software. In return, Squiz will grant You and every other user of the Software a
perpetual, world-wide, royalty-free, non-revokable, non-exclusive licence to use
the Modifications.

2.5 You agree to waive all moral rights that You may have in any Modifications
You make. You consent to the use of Your Modifications by Squiz.Net or any other
user under a licence on the terms of this or another substantially similar
licence, even if you might regard that use as derogatory treatment under moral
rights laws.

2.6 If You make available to Squiz.Net, or any other user, any of Your
Modifications, You represent to Us that these are Your original work and that,
as far as You are aware, neither it or its assignment, licence or use under this
Licence or another licence on these terms infringes the intellectual property
rights of any other person other than a patent identified by a notation made in
the source code you have made available.

2.7 If the assignment in clause 2.4 is ineffective for any reason, You grant to
Squiz.Net a royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use all intellectual
property rights You have in all Modifications to the Software, including the
right to grant licences to others on the terms of this or another substantially
similar Licence.

2.8 You must Notify Squiz.Net within 30 days of making any Modifications even if
You do not intend to distribute those Modifications. Notify is defined in Clause
4.2 below. If Your Modifications are incomplete, You must still Notify Squiz of
the status of your progress not less frequently than once every 30 days. If You
do not Notify Squiz.Net of Modifications You have made (complete or not) within
30 days, Squiz.Net may deem that you have opted to limit your obligations in
accordance with Clause 3 and as such Squiz.Net may reasonably charge You the
consideration indicated in Clause 3.

2.9 Squiz may choose to publish any notice you provide in accordance with
Clause 2.8 on its website or elsewhere for the benefit of other users of the
Software. You hereby grant Squiz.Net the right to publish Your notice where
We see fit. You will not charge Squiz.Net any fee for this right.

2.10 You are obliged to promptly provide a copy of any Modifications You make to
any other party that requests a copy of Your Modifications and in a format
reasonably requested by them. You may not charge any fee for complying with this
obligation except for the reimbursement of reasonable costs. If you provide
Squiz.Net with a copy of Your Modifications and Squiz.Net make Your
Modifications available for download from Our website, then this will be deemed
to satisfy the requirements of this clause.

3. Option to Limit Obligation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 In return for a mutually agreed consideration, Squiz.Net may, at its own
discretion and without requirement, choose to conditionally release You from
some of Your obligations under this Licence. Specifically, Squiz.Net may choose
to conditionally waive Your obligation to:

(a)  distribute Modifications under the same terms as this Licence as specified
     in Clause 1.1;
(b)  assign copyright to Squiz.Net as specified in Clause 2.4;
(c)  grant Squiz.Net perpetual royalty free use of Your Modifications as
     specified in Clause 2.7;
(d)  Notify Squiz of Your Modifications as specified in Clause 2.8; or
(e)  provide copies of your Modifications on request as specified in
     Clause 2.10.

For this Clause to operate, you must:

(i)   have the written consent of Squiz.Net;
(ii)  adhere to all of the conditions of Squiz.Net's written consent; and
(iii) have paid the agreed consideration in full.

4. General Terms and Conditions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Interpretation

Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. The
following rules apply unless the context requires otherwise:

(a)  Examples given in this Licence are non-limiting. The words "including" and
     "includes" are non-limiting;
(b)  words in the singular number include the plural and vice versa;
(c)  where a word or phrase is given a particular meaning, other parts of speech
     and grammatical forms of that word or phrase have corresponding meanings;

Modifications means any alterations, additions, enhancements, extensions,

To avoid doubt if You extend or enhance the Software through the creation of new
functionality that may be optionally installed (commonly called "modules" or
"custom assets"), and these extensions or enhancements are specifically written
to operate primarily with the Software, then these extensions or enhancements
are also to be considered Modifications and must therefore be covered by the
terms of this Licence.

any Modifications You make. The notice must as a minimum:

(a)  explain the purpose of the Modifications;
(b)  list which files were affected by the Modifications;

(d)  state how complete You believe the Modifications are;
(e)  state the intended purpose of the Modifications;
(f)  clearly and accurately identify who You are; and
(g)  provide information on how You may be easily contacted.

You must supply this notice to Squiz by one of the following methods:

      licence was written);
(ii)  by faxing it to Squiz.Net's registered office (+61 2 9568 6733 at the time
      this licence was written); or
(iii) by submitting it through the form provided at Squiz's website
