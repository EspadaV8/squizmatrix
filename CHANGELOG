MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG

SION 4.2.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Version numbers in __data URLs [ Feature Request #4808 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

It's difficult to manage cache expiration of statically served content, since this content is served blind by apache.

That is, you can edit a file, or CSS asset for example, but until the browser forces the request of a new version (further compounded by reverse proxies), the old version will continue to be served.

A common pattern for dealing with this is to add version numbers to the URL for the static file. Often, this is simply added as a query string for simplicity.

The effect being, when the file is updated and you bust the cache on the page, the URL for the file is different (since it's versioned), and so the browser gets the fresh version of the asset.

This can be a huge boost in caching strategies, allowing people to be more aggressive with their cache policy and empowering them to bust the 'perceived' cache on static files more easily.

TRIM Feature Request for Cron Job [ Feature Request #4875 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Added ability to modify the (when) attribute of the saved search cron job through the details interface.

Also added a custom field in saved search to allow the result set to contain a text version of a records container called (Container Title)

	Remap Manager: Never Delete Enhancements [ Feature Request #4890 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	The Remap Manager's Never Delete option allows you to lock specific remaps from being deleted. This new feature improves this existing functionality by adding a variety of enhancements.

	A new option has been added to the Remap Manager to purge all remaps in the system except those marked as Never Delete. This option is enabled through a new field on the Details screen of the Remap Manager.

	Setting this field to Yes and clicking Commit will purge all remaps in the system that are not marked as Never Delete.

	The Web Paths screen of an asset would previously list its remaps but would provide no indication of whether the remap was marked as Never Delete or not. A new column has now been added for remaps on the Web Paths screen to display whether the remap is marked as Never Delete.

	Previously, delete fields were available to all remaps listed in the Remap Manager or on the Web Paths screens of assets. These fields were ineffective when used on remaps marked as Never Delete, however they were still accessible. These delete fields will now only be enabled for use on remaps not marked as Never Delete. The delete field will be disabled on remaps marked as Never Delete, as shown in the figure above.

	The Remap Manager's Never Delete Added Remaps? field will now be disabled by default, meaning that users must manually enable this option. This field was previously enabled by default; Existing installations using the previous default will retain their settings when being updating.

	Slight performance improvement in rebuilding cache [ Feature Request #4925 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	A slight performance improvement can be achieved by testing if the asset has no urls first up and finishing, since a url is needed to be indexed by funnelback.

	Improved permissions in Squiz Search [ Feature Request #4926 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Improved permissions in Squiz Search will be handled by adding the systemid to all but the public key when retrieving the sitemap.
