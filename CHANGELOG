MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG


VERSION 3.5.0 Beta

Featured Changes
----------------------

Session Timeouts

	A new feature has been added to allow user sessions within MySource Matrix to be maintained for a customisable period of time (eg. 7 days).
	A user is able to keep their session information (including login details and shopping basket contents) for a period of time without having to have their web browser open for the entire period. They could
	log into MySource Matrix, edit some content, come back in 3 days and still be logged in.

	The 3 different types of session timeout options that can be set are:
	- whether a user's session should expire when they close their browser
	- whether a user's session should expire when they've been inactive for a certain period of time
	- whether a user's session should expire if they haven't authenticated for a certain period of time

	The feature has been added as a global/group preference rather than a system wide configuration setting, so you can choose to customise session timeout options per user group if you require, or use the global preference for all users.

Oracle Support

	A number of additional changes have been made to the MySource Matrix database schema and source code to allow MySource Matrix to run on an
	Oracle database. MySource Matrix can be installed and run on Oracle 9i but has not undergone thorough testing. Oracle support should be
	considered preliminary but one development team will be doing all new development on an Oracle database instead of PostgreSQL.

Paint Layouts

	A new concept called Paint Layouts has been added to MySource Matrix. Paint layouts are like designs for your content. You can crate a paint
	layout and customise how individual types of assets should look. For example, a news asset might be printed a certain way by default, but a
	paint layout could be created so you can define your own way it is printed. Keywords are used to place attributes and metadata values of the asset on the screen.

Log Manager

	A new log manager system asset has been created to help manage the rotation of system log files. The Log Manager also allows
	users to configure custom log rotation schedules as well as view existing system logs from the administration interface.

Backend Translation

	The MySource Matrix backend is now multi-language capable, meaning all string and error messages can be translated into languages other than English
	Currently, the backend interface is only available in English, but support for other languages is planned.

Asset Map Changes

	Many changes have been made to the asset map to improve usability for larger systems and to fix some of the bugs that existed. The main new features are multiple tree support, undockable view and multiple move/clone/link operations.

Triggers

	A triggering system has been added to MySource Matrix to help users complete repetitive task and to enforce system wide business rules. For
	example, you can configure a trigger in the system so that when Image assets are created under your site, they are automatically resized to 3 size variations, and added to the Media Folder.
