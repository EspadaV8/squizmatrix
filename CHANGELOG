MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG

VERSION 3.18.0 RC1

Featured Changes
-----------------------------------

Rewrite To Run On PHP 5

	The MySource Matrix codebase has been revised significantly so that it will run on PHP 5. This was partly necessitated by PHP's recent end-of-life announcement for PHP 4.x. The minimum PHP version required for MySource Matrix 3.18.x is PHP 5.1.6 - this is the version supplied with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.


CSV Data Source Asset

	This new asset type, located in the Data package, allows you to store a comma-separated value (CSV) text file. Each row within the CSV file is turned into a Data Record shadow asset.


XML Data Source Asset

	This new asset type, located in the Data package, allows you to capture tags of a certain name from an XML source (not necessarily an RSS feed), and translate them into Data Record shadow assets.


Weather Company Feed Asset

	This new asset type, located in the Data package, is a specialised form of XML Data Source asset, allowing subscribers to The Weather Company's RSS feed services to display data from those feeds as shadow assets in their MySource Matrix system, so they can be listed by Matrix's tools.


Rich Text Format File Asset

	This new asset type, part of Core asset package, is a specialised form of File asset that handles Rich Text Format (.rtf) documents. It has no additional function above what the File asset allows, however it allows RTF files to be handled separately in situations such as asset type customisation.


Optional Purge Root Added to Purge Trash Script

	The purge_trash.php script now accepts an extra parameter - the ID of an asset currently in the trash. If provided, only this asset and their children will be purged, instead of the entire trash. If this extra argument is omitted, the entire trash will be purged as usual.


"Hide Frames By Default" User Preference

	This new user preference will, when turned on, hide the frames (ie. the top bar and asset map handle) in Simple Edit mode by default, leaving only your content visible.


Asset Status Condition Asset

	This new System Condition tests an asset's current status against one or more selected statuses, returning TRUE or FALSE as a result.


Option to Offer HTTP Authentication

	If you enable HTTP authentication on the System Configuration screen (as well as Process PHP Credentials), and also append the query string "USE_HTTP_LOGIN=1" to the login URL, MySource Matrix will now present a browser-level HTTP authentication dialogue box instead of Matrix's usual login prompt.


Import Script Creates File Types Based On Extension

	The import_files.php script will now create assets of more common file types (MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, RTF File, Text File) instead of standard File assets, based on file extension. This extends existing functionality which handled MS Word, PDF and Image files.


New Folder Structure Import Script

	This new sscript allows you to import a flat structure of existing directories into Folder assets under a specified root node. Folders will be named the same as the directories on the filesystem. Directories can then be optionally be renamed to their new asset IDs, allowing the use of the import_files.php script immediately after.


New CSV-Based Import Script

	This new script converts information from three CSV files into assets of a single type. One file provides attribute and metadata values, and the other two files provide a mapping between field names located in the CSV file, and attribute and metadata values.


Multiple Page Page Renaming

	Normally, Multiple Page Page assets are named and renamed based on their position under the parent Multiple Page asset. Now, the web path of these assets can be changed from their default. If these new web-paths are non-numeric, they will not be renamed again when the pages are next re-ordered.



Additional Changes and Bug Fixes
-----------------------------------

Core

+ Performance improvements to the storage and execution of lookup values (ie: calculation of designs and paint layouts)
+ Improvements to HIPO locking algorithm: some HIPOs will lock one asset at a time, rather than locking the entire work set
* WYSIWYG elements now use internal PHP 5 HTML Tidy extension, instead of using an external tool version
* Custom DSNs changed from PEAR DB standard to PDO standard (Set Cache Expiry Trigger Action)

Data
