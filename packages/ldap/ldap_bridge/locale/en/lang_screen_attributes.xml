		<note><![CDATA[Whether <em>Group Membership</em> or <em>Group Members</em> should be used depends on how relationships between users and groups are defined:<ul><li><em>Group Membership</em> should be used when the <em>user defines the groups it is a member of</em>, with an attribute containing a list of group DNs (usually "ou").</li><li><em>Group Members</em> should be used when a <em>group defines its own members</em>, using an attribute containing a list of member DNs (usually "member" or "uniqueMember").</li></ul>Only one of <em>Group Membership</em> and <em>Group Members</em> are required. If both are provided, groups will be expanded according to the <em>Group Members</em> setting, however the groups a user is a member of will be determined by the <em>Group Membership</em> setting first. If only <em>Group Membership</em> is provided, groups will not be expanded.]]></note>
