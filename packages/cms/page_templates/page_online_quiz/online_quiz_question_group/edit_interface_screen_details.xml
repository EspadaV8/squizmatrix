	    <note>Score ranges can be categorised in this section, by specifying a category name and a score range. For example: A range named &quot;Low&quot; may correspond to a Question Group score of between 0 and 10 points. The score ranges are inclusive and can be closed (eg; between 0 and 10) or open-ended (eg; 10 or higher) - this is achieved by omitting a number from the open end of the score range.</note>
