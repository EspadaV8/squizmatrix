		<note><![CDATA[<p>Each Numeric, Selection-type or Tickbox Table question can have an ecommerce rule set, to relate a question with a monetary value which is then added to the order total (along with any products added to a cart). To enable a question, check the <strong>Ecom Enabled?</strong> box and commit the screen. Once enabled, ecommerce rules apply in this way:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>For Numeric questions, there are no options you can set. The value entered by the user becomes the amount added to the order total.</li>
		<li>For other questions, you can enter a value for each possible option from this screen. If an option is selected, the entered value will be added to the order total.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If the <strong>Is Taxable?</strong> option is set, the value of the question <strong>includes</strong> any tax rate set on the Details screen.</p>]]></note>
