+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The combination of a major and a minor asset come together to form a link. The Major asset
is always the asset on which createLink() and deleteLink() is called.

+-------------+
   EXCLUSIVE   
+-------------+

  * This type of link is the "strongest".
  * EXCLUSIVE links are used for asset navigation
  * The Minor Asset cannot be created as another minor asset in either an EXCLUSIVE or UNITE link
  * When the major asset is deleted (moved to trash) so is the minor asset
  * When the minor asset is deleted, nothing happens to the major asset

+-------------+
     UNITE     
+-------------+

  * This type of link is used for the elementary parent-child relationship
  * UNITE links are used for asset navigation
  * When the major asset of this link is deleted (moved to trash), the minor asset is checked to 
    see if it is a minor asset in any other UNITE link, if not then it is deleted.
  * When the minor asset is deleted, nothing happens to the major asset

+-------------+
    NOTICE     
+-------------+

  * This link is used just to notify the minor asset that another asset is linking to it 
    (either in content or some such event), but it's not a critical situation if the link 
    ends up disappearing
  * When the major asset is deleted, nothing happens to the minor asset
  * When the minor asset is deleted, it notifies the major asset of this deletion so any
    content can be updated (or at least the maintainers notified)
