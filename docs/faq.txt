Q. Why is my toolbar still disabled when my popup window closes?
A. You may have popup blocker software interfering with the contents of the popup. The google toolbar is a known culprit. Try allowing popups from the editing URL. For example, if you edit through the URL test.com/_edit - configure your popup blocking software to allow popups from the URL test.com.
